Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze retail sales data stored in PostgreSQL using Python and Streamlit. 
The analysis includes generating insights such as top-selling products, revenue trends, profit margins, and regional performance. 
Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application for querying and visualizing the data dynamically.

Features
Data Handling: Split raw retail data into normalized tables with primary and foreign key relationships.
Database Integration: Store and query data from a PostgreSQL database.

Insightful Queries:
Top-selling products by revenue.
Monthly sales trends (year-over-year comparison).
Product performance categorization.
Regional sales analysis.
Discount impact on sales.

Interactive Web App:
Query selection from predefined options.
Data visualization using Streamlit's charts and tables.
Setup Instructions

Prerequisites:
Visual studio code
